# NCoins

### Programing Language:
Python

### Purpose:
This program compares between the execution time of <br>
Dynamic Programming and Divide-and-Conquer solutions for NCoins problem.

### How it works:
The user inputs the desired amount of change. <br>
The available coin denominations are 1 cent, 5 cents, 10 cents, 12 cents, and 25 cents.

The program calculates how many coins will be returned as change with the DP and the DAC solutions, <br>
and calculates the time of execution.

In addition, in DP, the program will return the denominations for the change.

The optimum solution is one with the least amount of coins.
